            <description><![CDATA[Responsible AI principles and practices are even more critical in the current fast-paced Generative AI ecosystem. This is the start of my learning journey to build a Responsible AI cookbook with useful recipes for generative AI developers.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Welcome to the kickoff of my latest project - a Responsible AI Cookbook. This is a personal learning project to explore the increasingly critical area of responsible AI - from core concepts and principles, to developer tools and workflows - with specific focus on the <strong>generative AI applications</strong> ecosystem. In this first post, I'll set the stage by defining a roadmap for what I want to learn, and explaining why I want to use the #30Days model for building a cookbook for developers.</p>

<p>As an AI Advocate at Microsoft, I've spent the last six months exploring different aspects of the Generative AI landscape - from <a href="https://dev.to/azure/prompt-engineering-fundamentals-generative-ai-for-beginners-v1-1kii" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prompt Engineering</a> and <a href="https://dev.to/azure/fine-tuning-fundamentals-generative-ai-for-beginners-v2-3lf9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fine Tuning</a> fundamentals to <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/ai-ai-platform-blog/a-code-first-experience-for-building-a-copilot-with-azure-ai/ba-p/4058659" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code-first Development</a> using Azure AI Studio. But it wasn't till I started working on a <a href="https://dev.to/azure/responsible-ai-for-developers-resources-for-self-guided-learning-3lf9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Responsible AI Hub For Developers</a> that I realized how <em>responsible AI</em> became critical to every step of the end-to-end development workflow (LLM Ops) for generative AI solutions.</p>
<p>And while there was a lot of information about responsible AI, it was scattered across different locations - from open-source toolboxes for data scientists, to cloud-based integrations for operationalization, and community-based forums for discussing real-world case studies and best practices. I needed a way to explore this in a <em>structured</em> manner, and build myself a "cookbook" of useful recipes that I could revisit to find the right tool or process for a given task.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-what-is-responsible-ai">2. What is Responsible AI?<a href="https://30daysof.github.io/responsible-ai/cookbook-kickoff#2-what-is-responsible-ai" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2. What is Responsible AI?" title="Direct link to 2. What is Responsible AI?">​</a></h2>
<p>Responsible AI is a <a href="https://responsibleaitoolbox.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fundamental approach</a> to designing, developing, assessing, and deploying, AI solutions in a <strong>safe, trustworthy and ethical manner</strong>. Microsoft has an organization-wide <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Responsible AI</a> standard and playbook anchored by six principles:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fairness</strong> - AI systems should treat all people fairly.</li>
<li><strong>Reliability and Safety</strong> - AI systems should perform reliably and safely (even under unplanned conditions).</li>
<li><strong>Privacy and Security</strong> - AI systems should be secure and respect privacy (think system security and user data privacy)</li>
<li><strong>Inclusiveness</strong> - AI systems should empower everyone and engage people (think about accessible experiences)</li>
<li><strong>Transparency</strong> - AI systems should be understandable. (think about interpretability and explainability for decisions)</li>
<li>Accountability - People should be accountable for AI systems (think about oversight and guardrails for ensuring compliance)</li>
</ol>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Principles of Responsible AI" src="https://30daysof.github.io/responsible-ai/assets/images/000-responsibleai-principles-8175eee34dc5e0e1a6f6445d5f2e260a.png" width="1892" height="1064" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>My perspective here is that we need to <em>shift left</em> in the application lifecycle when it comes to detecting and mitigating or eliminating potential harms that can adversely impact responsible AI usage. And that means raising <strong>developer awareness</strong> of these issues and documenting <strong>actionable recipes</strong> that can be integrated into their design thinking and developer workflows.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-my-30days-roadmap">3. My #30Days Roadmap<a href="https://30daysof.github.io/responsible-ai/cookbook-kickoff#3-my-30days-roadmap" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. My #30Days Roadmap" title="Direct link to 3. My #30Days Roadmap">​</a></h2>
<p>My #30DaysOf platform and process started off as a way to create <em>themed month</em> content to give learners a deep-dive into a given topic in the span of four weeks. However, I want to repurpose the format for <em>self-paced learning</em> by keeping the same structure (roadmap) but without the time pressure for completion (30 days). The <em>Cookbook</em> format seemed to work best:</p>
<ol>
<li>The #30Days site becomes a developer cookbook for a given topic.</li>
<li>The Roadmap is the table-of-contents, organized as top-level collections.</li>
<li>The Collection is a set of recipes focused on a particular sub-topic.</li>
<li>Each Recipe has an explainer (what is it) and an exercise (how do I use it).</li>
</ol>
<p>My immediate goal is to build this cookbook <strong>for my own use</strong> - all mistakes and misconceptions are mine and the content is intended for learning purposes only and not for production use. With that in mind, my first steps are to find all relevant learning resources and organize them into a hierarchical roadmap (tree of nodes) with the following top-level nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Core Concepts - understand key terminology and building blocks</li>
<li>Developer Tools - explore key tools and workflows for developers</li>
<li>Generative AI - understand Responsible AI usage for LLM Ops</li>
<li>Advanced Topics - covers research, best practices &amp; new projects.</li>
</ul>

Generative AI and LLM Ops<a href="https://30daysof.github.io/responsible-ai/cookbook-kickoff#4-generative-ai-and-llm-ops" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 4.

<p>Traditional AI applications focused on training models with domain-specific datasets, and deploying <em>predictive AI</em> endpoints that applications could use for decision-making. Modern <em>generative AI</em> applications focus on pre-trained "large language models" trained on massive internet-scale data, with endpoints that applications can use for generating original content (text, code, images, audio, video etc.).</p>
<p>This unlocks a whole new range of user experiences driven by <em>natural language</em> interactions (chat), driving a paradigm shift from MLOps to LLMOps. In my day job as an AI Advocate at Microsoft, I focus on how we can use the <a href="https://ai.azure.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure AI platform</a> to streamline the end-to-end development of Generative AI applications - and use this figure to explain what the LLM Ops (or end-to-end application lifecycle) would involve.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/552316i571E7F652BBB7F1C/image-size/large?v=v2&amp;px=999" alt="LLM Ops Workflow" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>When we think about Responsible AI in the context of this workflow, we have to <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/training/modules/responsible-generative-ai/2-plan-responsible-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plan a responsible generative AI solution</a> with 4 steps:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Identify</em> potential harms relevant to your solution</li>
<li><em>Evaluate</em> presence of harms in generated outputs</li>
<li><em>Mitigate</em> harms at multiple levels to minimize impact</li>
<li><em>Operate</em> solution responsibly with an ops readiness plan.</li>
</ul>
<p>With the Azure AI platform, this is captured in the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/concepts/evaluation-approach-gen-ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">approach to generative AI evaluations</a>, the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/responsible-use-of-ai-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">responsible AI guidelines for Azure AI services</a> and the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-studio/concepts/content-filtering" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">content filtering system</a>for deployments.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-studio/media/evaluations/evaluation-monitor-flow.png" alt="Evaluation" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The figure above gives us a high-level sense for where these mechanisms fit against the three stages in the LLM Ops diagram above. And just last week, the team announced <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/announcing-new-tools-in-azure-ai-to-help-you-build-more-secure-and-trustworthy-generative-ai-applications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new tools for building secure and trustworthy generative AI applications</a> that enhance the workflow even more to tackle challenges like prompt injection attacks, vulnerability to jailbreaking, detection of "hallucinations" and more.</p>

<p>My next step is to build a roadmap (table of contents with links to relevant resources) to help me plan out my learning journey. Stay tuned!</p>]]></content:encoded>
