# About This Project

|![Responsible AI](./img/rai.jpeg)|
|:---:|
| This repository captures notes and notebooks for learning the core principles of Responsible AI and applying them in practice using the Responsible AI Toolbox. The goal is to work through the concepts with hands-on exercises, one notebook at a time. The instructions should allow you to extend or replicate the steps with alternative datasets.|

## Learn By Doing

Each hands-on lab is captured by three elements:

 - **Instructions** - a named _Markdown_ file or folder (in `docs/` folder). 
 - **Exercise** -  named _Jupyter Notebook_ (in `notebooks/` folder).
 - **Solution** - _static HTML_ version of notebook (in `docs/notebooks` folder)

## Using MkDocs

The documentation is built using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/), a static site generator where _content_ is written in Markdown, and _configuration_ is defined in a single `mkdocs.yml` file. 

Key commands for usage:
 - `mkdocs serve` - Preview docs locally (live reload)
 - `mkdocs build` - Build the static docs for deploys
